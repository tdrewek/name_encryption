# name_encryption

A simple python program to encrypt a name or phrase.

## Installation/Download

Python will be required to be installed on your system to run this program. 
The latest version of Python is recommended but not required.

You may choose to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tdrewek/name_encryption.git
```
Or you may choose to download the zip file [here](https://github.com/tdrewek/name_encryption/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) .

## Usage

Open a terminal/console and navigate to the folder "name_encryption" if cloned or "name_encryption-main" if downloaded. Once in the directory, you can run the program one of two ways depending on the Python version you have installed on your system:

If using Python v3.x.x run:

```

This program will first ask the user to enter a name/phrase and hit 'enter'.
