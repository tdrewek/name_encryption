# name_encryption

A simple Python program to encrypt a name or phrase. This algorithm will always encrypt the name/phrase in a different way each time the program is executed. A new key is generated at random upon run-time. Therefore, it will be impossible to decrypt the same name/phrase with the same key after the program has finished running. You should expext to see different encrypted results each time the program is executed.

## Disclaimer

As of right now, this program is only a demonstration of my knowledge on encryption for a class homework assignment. In the future, I plan to revisit this project increasing the complexity and usability. The random key generation upon run-time is not practical, but I have implemented it to show knowledge for the assignment. Later, I plan to remove this feature and implement a more sophisticated and reasonable key encryption algorithm. Thank you! 

## Installation/Download

Python will be required to be installed on your system to run this program. 
The latest version of Python is recommended but not required. You can download Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).


You may choose to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tdrewek/name_encryption.git
```
Or you may choose to download the zip file [here](https://github.com/tdrewek/name_encryption/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

## Usage

Open a terminal/console and navigate to the folder "name_encryption" if cloned or "name_encryption-main" if downloaded.

Once in the directory, you can run the program one of two ways depending on the Python version you have installed on your system:

If using Python v3.x.x, run:
```bash
python3 main.py
```

If using Python v2.x.x or older, run:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Example

```
(*)Enter name/phrase to encrypt: Thank you for reading my README!


----> After  encryption : 6ie.dj{5(jp5*j*ae8g.rjS{jN/P\k/[


(*)Enter encrypted message to decrypt: 6ie.dj{5(jp5*j*ae8g.rjS{jN/P\k/[


----> Original  message : Thank you for reading my README!
```
